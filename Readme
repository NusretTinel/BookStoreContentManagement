# 📚 Book Store Content Management System

This is a simple content management system for a bookstore.  
It allows users to:

- 📥 Add new books
- 🗑️ Delete existing books
- 📝 Update book details
- 🔍 View current book inventory
- 👤 Manage authors and staff

The system is written in **Python using Flask**, and includes both backend and frontend in a single codebase.  
It provides a web interface for interacting with the store data — no external admin panel or frontend framework required.
